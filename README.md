# Project Euler
My solutions to the challenging Project Euler puzzles ([see here](https://projecteuler.net/)). Most will be written for Mathematica, but some in PHP and  C/C++. I will certainly not claim that my solutions are efficient, but they usually get the job done. Sometimes I just brute-force my way through, so apologies in advance for some cringe-worthy lack of finesse.

I will never post the actual solution to the problems. But giving out problem solving strategies is not entirely spoiler free either of course...
